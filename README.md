# Our Homeschooling Journey

## About Us

#### My name is rafayel and me and my brother zaviel are homeschooled. We startedalmost a year ago and i don't regret it. the reson my mum took us out of school is that she tought that we could do so much more if we don't waste time on topics we don't want to pursue. Since we start i have got alot of new hobbies incleding movie making,(there is a link to my youtube channel) coding and wathching star trek. We loved star trek so much that we decided to write reviews (agian a link to our reviews)! home schooling is so good that me and my brother, 10 and 11, have taken our foundation maths gcse. Also we are preparing for our english and foundation science and higher maths! i would total recomend homschooling.
